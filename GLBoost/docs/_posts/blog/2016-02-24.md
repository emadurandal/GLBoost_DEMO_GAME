Hi there, I'm @emadurandal, the author of GLBoost WebGL rendering library.
For now on, I'm going to write anything about GLBoost.

The embarrassing thing is that my english is still limited.
So if I write something strange, please give me some slack:)

GLBoost aim 3D geeks and Heavy 3D Game Program use.
It is still under early development stage and does not have even explicit version number.

But I have a great enthusiasm for this library.
I'm planning to release ver 0.0.1 within this year.
